##The plus operator is very similar to the star operator, except that the character or subexpression followed by a "+" sign has to be repeated at least one time. Here follows the solution to our exercise with the plus quantifier: 

Solution with the plus quantifier:
r"^[0-9]+ "
99
##et's assume you want to recognize the last lines of addresses on envelopes in Switzerland. 
These lines usually contain a four digits long post code followed by a blank and a city name. 
Using + or * are too unspecific for our purpose and the following expression seems to be too clumsy:
r"^[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9] [A-Za-z]+"
##Fortunately, there is an alternative available:
r"^[0-9]{4} [A-Za-z]*"
###et's assume that there is no city name in Switzerland, which consists of less than 3 letters, at least 3 letters. 
We can denote this by [A-Za-z]{3,}.
###note the comma there which will allow for more than the three letters in the swiss city names
###Now we have to recognize lines with German post code (5 digits) lines as well, i.e. 
the post code can now consist of either four or five digits:
r"^[0-9]{4,5} [A-Z][a-z]{2,}"
###The general syntax is {from, to}: this means that the expression has to appear at least 
"from" times and not more than "to" times. {, to} is an abbreviated spelling for {0,to} and {from,} 
is an abbreviation for "at least from times but no upper limit"
###We can group a part of a regular expression by surrounding it with parenthesis (round brackets). 
This way we can apply operators to the complete group instead of a single character.

###Backreferences match the same text as previously matched by a capturing group. ...
###Parenthesis (round brackets, braces) not only group subexpressions but they create back references as well. 
The part of the string matched by the grouped part of the regular expression, i.e. the 
subexpression in parenthesis, is stored in a back reference.
